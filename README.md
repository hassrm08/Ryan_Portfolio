# Ryan Hass DS Portfolio

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Data Science](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/) from the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay. I will earn my Graduate Certificate in December of 2021 and anticpate to graduate with my M.S. in May of 2023.

I have completed (or am currently enrolled in) the following coursework: DS700 - Foundations of Data Science, DS705 - Statistical Methods, DS710 - Programming for Data Science, DS715 - Data Warehousing, DS735 - Communicating about Data, DS740 - Data Mining and Machine Learning, DS780 - Data Science and Strategic Decision Making.

I will be completing the following in the coming semesters: DS730 - Big Data: High-Performance Computing, DS745 - Visualization and Unstructured Data Analysis, DS760 - Ethics of Data Science, DS775 - Prescriptive Analytics, and DS785 - Capstone.

Below I have highlighted some relevant project work displaying some of my technical skills at a high level. Examples are from both academic and professional experiences.

# [Project 1: Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/hassrm08/Loan_Predict)

The final project for DS 705 - Statistical Methods included the observation, cleaning, and analysis of loan data to predict the likelihood that a potential borrower would default on their loan.

Data was taken from 50,000 loans. The dataset included 30 potential predictor variables.

Feature engineering was used to analyze, transform, and combine/remove some variable to aid in the accuracy of the anaylsis.

The methods of analysis include a logistic regression model that was derived from the most relevant variables within the given data set including income, employment status, interest rate, salary, loan term, and overall applicant grade.

Overall, the logistic regression model created to predict if a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan is highly effective, accurately predicting loan status 57% of the time. The final classification threshold for loan status is equal to 0.82 for accuracy based on the maximized AUC and 0.80 for profit, which closely coincide with one another. The model optimized for accuracy correctly predicts loan status 57% of the time, while classifying good loans as good 51.0% of the time and bad loans as bad 79.8% of the time. The model optimized for profitability correctly predicts loan status with a percentage of 60%, while classifying good loans as good 56.3% of the time and bad loans as bad 73.4% of the time.

# [Project 2: Music Genre Popularity](https://github.com/hassrm08/Genre_Twitter_Analysis)

The final project for DS 710 - Programming for Data Science included an open ended analysis fo Twitter data using the Twitter API.

I chose to evaluate the popularity of musical genres based on their perceived popularity on Twitter. Popularity is determined in two ways. First, by overall tweet count within a predetermined amount of time and then by the number of exclamation marks used within those tweets.

Tweets were collected using the REST API through Python. The program grabbed (up to 5000) tweets that were categorized into genres.

The Twitter data was reviewed and cleaned prior to being exported for analysis in R.

Two methods were used (in R Studio) in order to evaluate the relationship between tweet count and exclamation mark count by genre. First, I evaluated the potential for a linear relationship between both variables. The variables were plotted against one another in a scatterplot (Figure 3), and a summary of the linear model was created. Secondly, the variables (Tweet Count & Exclamation Count) were compared in a Chi Squared Test of Independence.

Both analyses indicate that there is likely no relationship between the number of tweets mentioning a specific genre and the amount of exclamation marks within those tweets. It is important to mention that popularity is assumed by Tweet count, therefore; popularity cannot be determined by the number of exclamation marks within tweets mentioning specific musical genres.

The figure above displays the relatinship between Exclamation count and Tweet count by Genre.


# [Project 3: Double Cross Validation](https://github.com/hassrm08/Double_CV)

The Double Cross Validation project is the Midterm project for DS740 - Data Mining and Machine Learning.

The goal of this project was to evaluate means of predicting the retail price of vehicles based on the predictors variables provided.

Additionally, model selection and assessment was done to determine the overall accuracy of the model as well as the model selction process using double cross validation techniques.

The analysis was done using the 'caret' package in R.

Feature engineering was practiced to evaluate predictor variables.

Robust Regression and Elestic Net Regression methods were compared.

Model performance was tuned by the use of different model parameters.

Based on the information above, and the performance of my model selection process (70.5%), the aforementioned Elastic Net model is sufficiently accurate for making new predictions on individual data points especially with lower cost vehicles as displayed by the tightness of the data points on the lower end of the scale in Figure 2. The model is best at predicting price when the vehicle is worth â‰ˆ$50,000 or less.

# [Project 4: Paper Quality Testing Gage Comparison](https://github.com/hassrm08/GBP_Data_Analysis)

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the correlation between different testing methods used to quantify paper strength.

Two main methods, S-test and Concora, were compared againast one another to determine which method is more reliable.

Tests on various paper grades were compared to determine if there was any correlative effects beween the testing methods.

Data was collected on various paper grades over a series of production runs. 

A full Gage R&R comparison was carried out with the Minitab statistical software. 

The results suggest that the S-test has a higher reliability based on the results of the Gage comparison.

In this case, it is recmoneded that Concora be phased out as the primary means of measuring machine direciton paper strength and the S-test should take its place.
