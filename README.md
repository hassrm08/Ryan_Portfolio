# [Project 1: Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/hassrm08/Loan_Predict)

The final project for DS 705 - Statistical Methods included the observation, cleaning, and analysis of loan data to predict the likelihood that a potential borrower would default on their loan.

Data was taken from 50,000 loans using 30 variables.

The methods of analysis include a logistic regression model that was derived from the most relevant variables within the given data set including income, employment status, interest rate, salary, loan term, and overall applicant grade.
